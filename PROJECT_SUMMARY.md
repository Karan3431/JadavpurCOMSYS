# Face Detection and Recognition Project Summary


This project implements two distinct computer vision tasks focused on face analysis:

- **Task A**: Gender Classification (Binary Classification)
- **Task B**: Face Recognition/Identification (Multi-class Classification with 877 unique individuals)

## Task A: Gender Classification

### Approach

#### 1. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressed the imbalance between male and female samples by augmenting the female class to reach approximately 950 samples
- **Augmentation Pipeline**: Implemented using Albumentations library with low-threshold transformations:
  - Resize to 224×224 pixels
  - Blur (blur_limit=3-5, p=0.3)
  - Gaussian Noise (p=0.3)
  - Random Brightness/Contrast (±0.1, p=0.3)
  - Random Rain effect (p=0.1)
  - Random Fog effect (p=0.1)

#### 2. Model Architecture
- **Backbone**: ResNet-50 with ImageNet pretrained weights
- **Custom Classification Head**: Single linear layer for binary classification
- **Output**: Single neuron with sigmoid activation for gender probability

#### 3. Training Strategy (Two-Phase Approach)
**Phase 1: Distortion Adaptation (5 epochs)**
- Frozen backbone parameters
- Train only the classification head
- AdamW optimizer (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4)
- BCEWithLogitsLoss criterion

**Phase 2: Full Fine-tuning (up to 50 epochs)**
- Unfrozen all parameters
- Differential learning rates:
  - Backbone: 1e-5
  - Classification head: 1e-3
- ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
- Early stopping (patience=7, delta=0.001)

#### 4. Evaluation Protocol
- Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
- F1-Score as primary metric
- Additional metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

### Results (Task A)

└── Recall:    97.39%
```

## Task B: Face Recognition/Identification

### Approach

#### 1. Data Organization
- **Dataset Structure**: 877 unique individuals
- **Data Reorganization**: Flattened nested directory structure from `person/distortion/images` to `person/images`
- **Train/Validation Split**: Separate reorganization for training and validation sets

#### 2. Feature Extraction Pipeline
- **Model**: FaceNet (InceptionResNetV1) pretrained on VGGFace2
- **Input Processing**:
  - Resize to 160×160 pixels
  - Normalization with mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
- **Output**: 512-dimensional face embeddings

#### 3. Classification Pipeline
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler for feature normalization
- **Classifier**: K-Nearest Neighbors (k=5) with cosine distance metric
- **Class Mapping**: JSON mapping for label-to-name conversion

#### 4. Verification Evaluation
- **Pair Generation**: Created 1000 positive and 1000 negative pairs
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity between embeddings
- **Threshold**: 0.6 for binary classification (same person vs. different person)

### Results (Task B)

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies and Environment
- **Core Framework**: PyTorch 2.0+
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Albumentations, torchvision
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, facenet-pytorch
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pillow, tqdm
- **Utilities**: gdown for dataset download

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Task A - Two-Phase Training**:
   - Prevents overfitting by gradual unfreezing
   - Allows backbone to adapt to face-specific features
   - Early stopping prevents overfitting

2. **Task B - FaceNet + KNN Approach**:
   - Leverages pretrained face embeddings for robust feature extraction
   - KNN with cosine distance suitable for high-dimensional face embeddings
   - Scalable approach for large number of classes (877 individuals)

3. **Data Augmentation Strategy**:
   - Conservative augmentation to preserve face identity
   - Addresses class imbalance while maintaining data quality

## Performance Analysis

### Task A Strengths
- **Excellent Performance**: >95% accuracy across all metrics
- **Balanced Results**: High precision and recall indicate robust classification
- **Effective Augmentation**: Successfully addressed class imbalance

### Task B Analysis
- **High Precision (96.85%)**: Low false positive rate - when model predicts "same person", it's usually correct
- **Low Recall (52.20%)**: Higher false negative rate - model is conservative in matching faces
- **Trade-off**: Model prioritizes avoiding false matches over capturing all true matches
- **ROC-AUC (85.12%)**: Indicates good discriminative ability despite threshold sensitivity

## Model Artifacts

### Task A Outputs
- `best_model.pt` (94MB): Trained ResNet-50 model for gender classification

### Task B Outputs
- `knn_model.pkl`: Trained K-Nearest Neighbors classifier
- `scaler.pkl`: StandardScaler for feature normalization
- `class_mapping.json`: Label-to-name mapping for 877 individuals
- `train_features.npy`: Extracted face embeddings (training set)
- `train_labels.npy`: Corresponding labels (training set)
- `val_embeddings.npy`: Validation set embeddings
- `val_labels.npy`: Validation set labels

## Conclusion

The project successfully implements both gender classification and face recognition tasks with distinct approaches tailored to each problem:

- **Task A** achieves excellent performance through careful data augmentation and two-phase training
- **Task B** demonstrates a production-ready face recognition system with high precision, suitable for applications where false positives are costly

The modular design allows for easy deployment and further optimization based on specific use case requirements.
